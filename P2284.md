# Motivation and Scope
State Machines are fundamental aspect of computer sience and are wildy used in the industry.
There are many aspects to consider when implementing a state machine framwork, and a good standard library can ease the burden for developers.

# Terminology
State Machine means different things to different people.
This sectoin sets the terminology for the rest of the paper.

## FSM
FSM is a Finite State Machine. It encapsulates everything this proposal suggests.<br>
The facility this paper proposed is called fsm.
```cpp
std::fsm my_fsm;
```
A FSM has the following responsibilities:<br>
* Holds its states 
* Holds a common context for all states
* Transit between states.

## State
A State is a position in the state machine. The state machine itself can rest, at a given time, only in a single state.

## Transition
A Transition is the move of the state machine from one state to another.

## Context
The context of a state machine is the common data or functionality that is accesible to all states.


```cpp
    std::fsm::state wait_for_input("wait-for-input");
    std::fsm::state open("open");
    std::fsm::state locked("locked");
    
    std::fsm::transition(wait_for_input, open, [](const std::string password) -> std::fsm::state& {
        if (fsm::context::retries > 3) {return locked;}
        if (password_ok(password)) {return open;}
        ++fsm::context::retries;
        return wait_for_input
    }
    int retries = 0;
    std::fsm<int> myfsm(retries);
```
# Open Issues
* Completeness: should all states handle all inputs?
** Yes: it is safer, it covers all possible situations.
** No: it is just too much effort from the developer point of view to force declarig handling of impossible combinations of state/input.
* Explicit and enforced states transitions vs. implicit and non enforced state transition
